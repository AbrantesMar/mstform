* verify that we can't do readonly or fromEvent for non-string raw
  values.

* a Group concept that aggregates validation values.

* implement show error after blur, show error after pause.

* maybefy doesn't seem to be the way to go. Can we instead
  create a no-read mode that:

  * doesn't ever read underlying value from the form. Instead it displays
    an empty value defined by the converter.

  * only upon first write tries to save the value to the underlying field.

  This needs to work for both whole forms (add form use case) as well
  as repeating items on a form.

  A field that has never been written should be considered invalid
  for the purposes of form submission.
